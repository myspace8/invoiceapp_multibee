Enhancements:
- Delete Dialog: Could add invoice ID/client name to the dialog for context (e.g., "Delete invoice #123 for John Doe?").
- Print: Could add a logo or header/footer in PrintInvoice. Let me know if you want this.
- Sort/Filter: Could add more filter options (e.g., by date range, total range) or save sort preference in localStorage.
- Validation: Could validate other fields (e.g., date required, location format) or use react-hook-form for better form management.
- UI: Could add loading states for save/delete, tooltips for buttons, or pagination for History tab if many invoices.
